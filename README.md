# mbtiproject
This is a personal project analyzing the top 250 Anime & Manga popular characters on https://www.personality-database.com/ <br />
On this website, users can vote for a character's personality type. It includes many different tests such as MBTI, Enneagram, etc. <br />
The data was collected myself via manual input from July 2023. <br />
The data is collected from votes, so some of the data may have changed from when I have collected it. <br />
If you use the data, please keep the above in mind and take care in cleaning the data for proper analysis. <br />
I researched the personality types included in this project, but my knowledge is not perfect. I will include a small summary here: <br /> 
<br />
top.csv: data file of the top 250 characters <br />
top250.py: python file analyzing the characters' personality types visually
mcode.py: python file with code that takes personality types as an input and outputs the characters that match most with the inputs (think of it as a fun quiz :) ) <br />
MBTIDashboard.pdf: a dashboard created from the data in Google Sheets using pivot tables and charts <br />
