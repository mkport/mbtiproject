# mbtiproject
## Introduction, Use Terms
This is a personal project analyzing the personality types of the top 250 Anime & Manga characters on [Personality Database](https://www.personality-database.com/). <br />
On this website, users can vote for a character's personality type. It includes many different tests such as MBTI, Enneagram, etc. <br />
The data was collected myself via manual input from July 2023. <br />
The data is collected from votes, so some of the data may have changed from when I have collected it. <br />
If you use the data, please keep the above in mind and take care in cleaning the data for proper analysis. <br />
Please use these project files for learning purposes only. Please do not claim the files as your own. <br />
